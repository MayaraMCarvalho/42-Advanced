|  **[ft_malcolm](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/2-ft_malcolm)**  |  An introduction to network security with Man In The Middle attack.  |  This project focuses on network security by implementing and analyzing a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack. The goal is to understand how this type of attack works in practice, intercepting and potentially altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.  |  <ul><li>Unix</li><li>Security</li><li>Network & system administration</li><ul>  |  
|  **[Piscine Cybersecurity](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/4-Piscine_Cybersecurity)**  |  <ul><li>Module 00 - Arachnida: Introductory project on scraping but also on the discovery of metadatas.</li><ul>  |  An introductory bootcamp (piscine) to cybersecurity. Module 00, "Arachnida," focuses on **information gathering (OSINT)** techniques, teaching how to create a web scraping tool to extract data from websites and analyze file **metadata** to uncover hidden information.  |  <ul><li>Web</li><li>Security</li><ul>  |

|  **[malloc](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/3-malloc)**  |  What’s the deal with malloc? You’ve been using it since the piscine C but it’s not a system call. Find out the workings behind optimum memory management and recode it, as well as free and realloc.  |  A deep dive into **dynamic memory management** in Unix. The project consists of re-coding the standard C library functions from scratch: ```malloc()```, ```free()```, and ```realloc()```. The challenge is to implement an efficient memory allocator capable of managing memory blocks on the heap and optimizing their usage.  |   <ul><li>Algorithms & AI</li><li>Unix</li><ul>  |

|  **[ft_linux](https://github.com/MayaraMCarvalho/1-ft_linux)**  |  The first project of the Kernel branch! This is a simple LFS so that you can build your own distribution which will be used in the next projects.  |  This project is an introduction to system administration and the Linux kernel, based on the **"Linux From Scratch" (LFS)** concept. The objective is to build a functional, **custom Linux distribution** from the source code, compiling the kernel and essential system utilities.  |  <ul><li>Rigor</li><li>Unix</li><li>Technology integration</li><ul>  |
